_In this application, you experience how powerful the term API is and you also get to explore one of the best sites to get amazing gifs which is: (giphy.com). I know you would definitely want to know what APi key I used, below which is the setup/Installation is where you can get all those. You get 3 amazing giphy features in this application, enjoy the APP_

## Setup/Installation
* First clone the project on your System(git clone _REPOSITORY-NAME_)
* Run npm install in the Terminal(e.g the git bash Terminal). with this, all of the dependencies of the application gets installed
* Then before running an "npm run start" which will build and start the application on a dev server here are a few things you will be needing for the application and those few things are:
* 1. An Environmental variable file: just create a file named .env(note: this is the place where you will be storing sensitive information like API keys and the likes)
* 2. Go to the website(giphy.com) or just type in giphy
* 3. Create a developer account which will make you able to generate API keys you will be needing for this application
* 4. Generate an API key with a name of your choice, now copy that api key(hint: an API key characters ranges from 20-25 characters) and then go to the .env file you created and in it create a variable(hint: variables created in a .env file are all capitalized and have an underscore_ separating each word) you can name your variable anything and then store your api key to be equal to that variable you created
* 5. Having done that, inside the index.js javascript file check to see a variable where I stored my openweathermap link in(endpoint) and in the "process.env.API_KEY" change it to a "process.env.API_KEY.THE_VARIABLE_NAME_YOU_STORED_YOUR_API_KEY_IN"
* 6. Ensure you take part in the no5 otherwise you'll get a "401: invalid api key" error. If you do get lost on the way, you can contact me below with the contact details I supplied below
